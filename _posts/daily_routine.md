My Daily Routine

I often wake up at around 7:20 a.m. Then I get up and get out of bed. I brush my teeth and wash my face, and sometimes I take a pee. After that, I drive to work. My car is an SUV made in China, but its brand is Japanese.

The traffic in the morning is usually  [**pretty**]  heavy, so I often feel  **a bit** anxious and frustrated while driving. Sometimes, I even have to run a red light, even though I know it’s dangerous.

When I arrive at the company, I eat breakfast. I usually have an egg, a piece of cake, half a corn cob, and some bread. Then I go into my office and start to work [**Then I start working**].

After three hours of work, I eat lunch at the company. It usually includes some meat, vegetables, and rice, which gives me enough energy for the afternoon. After I finish lunch, I usually take a nap, and then I start working again until about 6:30 p.m.

After work, I drive home and start to prepare dinner for my family. We usually eat dinner together, and I always think dinner is the most important part of the whole day.

After dinner, I watch TV for a while and play games with my daughter. Then I go to bed at around 10:00 p.m.
That’s my daily routine.

My Daily Routine (Spoken Version)

Well, I usually wake up around seven twenty in the morning. Then I get up, get out of bed, and brush my teeth and wash my face. Sometimes I also take a pee before I head out.

After that, I drive to work. My car’s an SUV made in China, but the brand is Japanese. The traffic in the morning is usually pretty heavy, so I often feel a bit anxious and frustrated while driving. Sometimes I even have to run a red light, though I know it’s dangerous — you know how it is during rush hour.

When I get to the office, I usually have breakfast — maybe an egg, a piece of cake, half a corn cob, and some bread. Then I start working.

After about three hours, I have lunch at the company. It usually comes with some meat, vegetables, and rice, which gives me enough energy for the rest of the day. Then I take a short nap before getting back to work until around six thirty.

After work, I drive home and start to prepare dinner for my family. We usually eat together, and honestly, I think dinner is the best part of the day. After dinner, I watch a bit of TV and play some games with my daughter. Then I usually go to bed around ten p.m.

So yeah — that’s pretty much my daily routine.
